The shaders folder contains the shader files and the states folder contains the various states that correspond to the character objects.

The character objects each inherit from the abstract BaseCharacter object so that the characters may be seemlessly managed in the CharacterManager object. Also each of the character objects contain a StateMachine<CharacterType> object to manage their states and are made to receive messages which will be handled in their respective states' onMessage() function.

The AIengine and PhysicsCalculator objects are instance objects that contain the functions that calculate ai-movement and collisions, respectively.

The Numbers.h and ScenicObjects.h files contain the vertex and index information for the various background objects.

The main game loop (using the VulkanRenderEngine) and character initialization is all managed in the Window object as well as creating the window and the key callbacks.

Finally, the main.cpp file contains the call to the main function and runs the game via a Window object, and the stdfx files are the pre-compiled header files.
